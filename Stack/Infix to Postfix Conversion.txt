1. Print operands as they arrive 
2. If stack is empty or contains a left paranthesis on top, 
   push the incomming operator onto the stack.
3. If incoming symbol is '(' push it onto stack 
4. If incoming symbol is ')' pop the stack & print the operatos 
   until left paranthesis is found
5. If incoming symbol has higher preccendence than the top off
   the stack, push it on the stack
6. If incoming symbol has lower preccendence than the top of the stack,
   pop & print the top. Then test the incoming operator against the new 
   top of the stack.
7. If incoming operator has equal precedence with the top of the stack,
   use associativity rule.
8. At the end of the expression, pop & print all operator of stack.
9. Associativity (Left to Right) then pop & print the top of the stack & 
   then push the in coming operator.
10.(Right to Left) then push the incoming operator.
